### Visualization 3

{(aim|}
The aim is to visualize the hard or denser structures in the teddy bear volume data, focusing on identifying the pattern on the hard surfaces be it the supporting structure for the teddy bear or the denser materials used on the teddy bear to represent eyes and the nose in comparison to the fur used within the teddy bear. It also helps in understanding the binding of the hard surfaces at a outer-surface level.

{(vismapping|}
```
Cell points: Imagefile
Color preset: GBBr
Data extent:
x-axis: 0 to 511
y-axis: 0 to 511
z-axis: 0 to 62
Representation: Volume
Contour Data Representation: Surface
Scaling mode: All approximate
Opacity: 1
```
{|vismapping)}

{(dataprep|}
The contour data is obtained after performing transformation to scale the data on the z-axis to obtain a pleasant visualization. Once the contour data is obtained, the mapping data is adjusted on the color map graphically to visualize the harder surfaces at a closer look.
{|dataprep)}

{(limitations|}
The visualization do not focus on the internal structures rather only on the outer surface, thereby not understanding the internal properties of the denser objects. The major focus should be the teddy bear and since this visualization focuses on denser objects, only a small portion i.e., eyes and nose buttons of the teddy bear is actually understood, it leaves a larger portion of teddy bear not understood in this particular visualization. The visualization should encompass other aspects of the teddy bear, varying density such as the covering of teddy bear and the inner fur should be visualized appropriately to understand the volumetric data of teddy bear better.
